This library implements a symple method to have long descriptions for objects that can be shown when examined. 

Instructions:

1) Copy the .pgl file in the jsl folder of your ngPAWS installation.
2) Change the location texts so they have two texts separated by a sharp character (#). For instance convert: "a chest" into "a chest#A heavy chest with a carved lion on it."
3) Make sure your "examine" verb is number 30 in the vocabulary.  If not, change "var examine_longdescription = 30;" in longdescription_lib.jsp to the right number
